Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is J. Xiong, currently a Research Assistant within the thrust of Smart Manufacturing (SMMG) of System Hub at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/). It is my privilege to be supervised by [Dr. Guo Daqiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3auvsZQAAAAJ&hl=en), who guides me into subjects involving Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), Internet of Things (IoT) and Sensors. The goal is to develop an HRC system capable of achieving high-quality monitoring of both physical and physiological conditions of human operators through the use of various sensors.
